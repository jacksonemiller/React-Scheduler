Minor typos I noticed:
On the page "Filter by time conflicts," the last block of code given for the App component is
missing the line "if (!schedule) return <h1>Loading schedule...</h1>;" which I think was
causing my page to not show anything for me.

Also on that page of the tutorial, the last block of code given for the Course component
I believe is missing the line "<div className="card-text">{ course.meets }</div>" to display
the scheduling info for the class.
