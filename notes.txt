Minor typos I noticed:

On the page "Filter by time conflicts," the last block of code given for the App component is
missing the line "if (!schedule) return <h1>Loading schedule...</h1>;" which I think was
causing my page to not show anything for me.

Also on that page of the tutorial, the last block of code given for the Course component
I believe is missing the line "<div className="card-text">{ course.meets }</div>" to display
the scheduling info for the class. 

On the page, "Store data," the boolean expression assigned to isDisabled is written as 
"const isDisabled = hasConflict(course, selected);" rather than the previously given 
"const isDisabled = !isSelected && hasConflict(course, selected);" which I think had the
effect of making selected classes appear grey rather than light green.

During the portion where we added the ability for users to change the scheduled times for classes,
I noticed a bug where when the time of a class was changed, if that class was selected at the time
of the edit, the program would find that it had a time conflict with itself, and would set the class
to be disabled. So, I tried to fix this by having the onDoubleClick action remove the double-clicked
course from the list of selected courses (if it was on it) in addition to calling reschedule().
It is a little annoying that you have to re-select courses after editing them, but it's pretty easy
to do that whereas before this bug got the course into a locked state where it was impossible to
un-disable it since it had conflicted with itself and, as it was disabled, you could no longer 
un-select it to remove the source of the conflict.
